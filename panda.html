        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First find your panda, should be a little plumpier than most</li>
            <li>Lure the panda towards you with your noodle dream(they very enjoy noodels)</li>
            <li>Get out your rifle or the tnt (if you have followed that recipe, which you should totally check out at <a href="index.html">my website</a>) and start to obliterate that bamboo eating piece of shit</li>
            <li>After thats done, and your inner roid rage stabilises, carry the panda to ur home and start cooking him like any other food</li>
            <li>Cook him at very high heat for 2 hours, the skin should start to become wet.</li>
            <li>After the panda looks like this image below, take out your british cutlery and start to devour him, your roid rage will absolutely enjoy this and you will feel like eddie hall but on crack.</li>
            <img src="download.jpeg" alt="panda">
            <li>and BOOM! You created your first panda. Very delicious I must say... uhh if you see some police officers outside with a document, take out ur spare tnt and throw it at them, you are NOT receiving a criminal charge for kidnapping an endangered animal</li>
        </ol>
